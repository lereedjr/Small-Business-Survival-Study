# Project Overview

Predicting Colorado Business Survival

Investing in a business is a serious commitment. The rewards are high for both the business owner and the community. Businesses create the jobs needed for a community to thrive. Many businesses fail however. I would like to help Colorado business owners determine the likelihood their business will succeed. I want to find driving factors that might help these businesses survive. This information will help possible business owners make the best decision about when and where to open their new business.

# Data Insights

Not time variant
Picked two years of data to limit aging impacts
Older years will not be the same as newer
Primary data set from Colorado data government SOS
Reviewed data on the BLS and IRS
Tried using Google places
Combined entity statuses as I thought was correct
Data set not perfectly balanced but pretty close
State of business origin matters
